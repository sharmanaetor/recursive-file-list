recursive-file-list
===================

List and store files in Java recursively. 

The listFiles function in Java gives you access to files and folders in the specified directory 
but this is given in the form of a flat array. 

I needed to convert this flat array in to a multi-dimensional array whose dimenstions are based on 
the depth of the folder structure.

This is that implementation.
